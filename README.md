## Git Branching Strategy

To make any changes, branch off from the `dev` branch. After making and testing those changes locally, create a pull request from your branch to the `dev` branch. Two people are needed to approve each pull request.

The `master` branch will be our 'production' branch which the `dev` branch will merge into after every significant new feature has been added. Five approvals for the pull request from the `dev` branch will be required.
